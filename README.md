# Electricity-Management-System-in-Android-
The project is an Android based application where users can get instant electricity bill and pay them online via credit card. The system automates the conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the place. Users have to stand in queue for paying bill and wait for their turn. The process is tiresome and time consuming. They even have to wait for the bill being delivered to their place which sometimes can be delivered late by the delivery boy. Hence the system is developed to automate the electricity bill calculation and payment for user convenience. The system would be having two logins admin and user login. Admin can view user account details and can even add or updates things in their account. Admin has to feed the system with electricity usage data into respective users account through online web application. The system then calculates the electricity bill for every user and updates the information into their account every month. User can then view their electricity bill and pay on the spot before month end. If user is incapable of paying the bill before month end, it then calculates fine for each day.
